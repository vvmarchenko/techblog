# Personal blog powered by Hugo 

This repository contains the source code for [techblog.pro](https://marchenko.blog/), a static blog website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a popular static website generator. The website uses the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) blog theme, which has been added to the repository as a Git submodule.

## ‚öôÔ∏èWebsite Deployment:
The website is deployed automatically using GitHub Actions, a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool provided by GitHub. The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.


## üåêWebsite Performance:
To improve website performance, I have configured the website to use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), a content delivery network (CDN) service. This CDN service caches the website files and serves them from a location closer to the website visitor, which results in faster page load times.

## üìùContributing:
If you find an issue with the website or want to suggest a new feature, please open an issue in this repository. Pull requests are also welcome.
