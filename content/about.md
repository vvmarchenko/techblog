My name is **Vladyslav Marchenko**, and I’m an IT Engineer from Ukraine🇺🇦.

My passion for technology and desire to learn more led me to explore the world of DevOps. I’m currently studying and practicing Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies such as ECS, EC2, S3, ASG, ALB, CloudFront, VPC etc. I also have experience managing configurations using Ansible, handling infrastructure with Terraform, creating modules, containerizing with Docker, working with networks, web servers, and Linux, and designing project architectures.

I always seek new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my field.

When I'm not diving into code or building infrastructure, I enjoy staying active with sports. For example, I enjoy boxing🥊, fitness🏋️‍♂️, and snowboarding🏂.Additionally, I love sharing my insights and experiences with others through my blog.

If you want to learn more about my background and experience,\

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey and insights on the latest in DevOps.

Thank you for reading!🤩
